# Investigation: World Foundry `iffcomp` File Format

**Date:** 2026-04-10
**Context:** Reverse-engineering the input and output formats of `iffcomp`, a flex/bison-based IFF chunk authoring tool from the [World Foundry](https://github.com/wbniv/WorldFoundry/tree/master/wftools/iffcomp) 3D engine project (1996–2003). Source: `wftools/iffcomp/` (lexer, grammar, sample) and `wfsource/source/iffwrite/` (the binary writer library).

There are really **two** formats here:

1. The textual *source* language eaten by `iffcomp` (`.iff.txt` / `.scr`).
2. The *binary* IFF tree it spits out.

Both are documented below.

## 1. The textual source language

A small flex+bison DSL whose only output is a binary IFF tree.

### Top-level structure

```
file        := chunk+
chunk       := '{' ID chunk-body '}'
chunk-body  := ( chunk | item | directive )*
```

A file is a sequence of `{ … }` chunks; chunks may nest arbitrarily. Comments are `// to end of line`. `include "f"` and `include <f>` pull in nested source files.

### Chunk IDs (`'TEST'`, `'FILE'`, …)

- 1–4 ASCII characters in **single** quotes (lexer rule `'.{1,4}'`).
- The lexer packs them MSB-first into a 32-bit value (`shift = 24; …`), then `ID(unsigned long)` byte-swaps it back so the on-disk bytes are literally `T E S T` in source order. Shorter IDs are right-padded with NULs (`'AB'` → `41 42 00 00`).

### Items (the things that produce bytes)

| Syntax | Emits |
|---|---|
| `123`, `-456`, `$DEADBEEF` | An integer. Width = current `sizeOverride` (default 1 byte). |
| `123y`, `123w`, `123l` | Same, but force width to 1 / 2 / 4 bytes respectively. Hex form `$1234w` works too. |
| `'AB'`, `'WAVE'` | A 4-byte FOURCC inline (uses `out_id`, which 4-aligns first). |
| `3.14`, `.5`, `3.0` | A fixed-point real using the current default precision. |
| `3.14(1.15.16)` | A fixed-point real with explicit `(sign.whole.fraction)` precision. Total-bit count picks int8 / int16 / int32. |
| `"hello"` | NUL-terminated C string. |
| `"hello"(256)` | NUL-terminated C string padded with zeros to *exactly* N bytes. Warns if too long. |
| `"abc" "def"` | Concatenation — `out_string_continue` seeks back over the previous NUL and appends. Result is one C string `"abcdef\0"`. |
| `[ "path/to/file.bin" ]` | Raw bytes of an external file, copied verbatim. |
| `[ "f.bin" .start(N) .length(M) ]` | Same but only the slice `[N, N+M)`. |
| `.timestamp` | Unix `time_t` as a 32-bit int. |
| `.offsetof('A'::'B')` | Back-patched 32-bit absolute file offset of chunk `A`→`B`'s payload. |
| `.offsetof('A'::'B', N)` | Same plus a constant byte offset. |
| `.sizeof('A'::'B')` | Back-patched 32-bit payload size of chunk `A`→`B`. |

`.offsetof` / `.sizeof` use a `Backpatch` queue: if the named chunk is already known when the directive is parsed, the value is written immediately; otherwise the current file position is recorded and the gap is filled in `Grammar::~Grammar()` after parsing finishes.

### Directives

| Syntax | Effect |
|---|---|
| `.align(N)` | Pad with fill bytes until current file position ≡ 0 (mod N). |
| `.fillchar(N)` | Set the byte value used for alignment padding (default 0). |

### State-push blocks (the other meaning of `{ … }`)

A `{` followed by a *non*-CHAR_LITERAL token is a temporary state push, popped at the matching `}`. Two flavours:

- `{ Y … }`, `{ W … }`, `{ L … }` — push a default integer width of 1 / 2 / 4 bytes for unsuffixed integers inside the block. Note this is **uppercase** Y/W/L (single chars), distinct from the lowercase `y/w/l` that suffix individual literals.
- `{ .precision(1.15.16) … }` — push a default fixed-point precision for unparenthesised reals inside the block.

The parser disambiguates "chunk vs. state-push" by lookahead: if the next token is a CHAR_LITERAL it's a chunk, otherwise a state push.

### Numeric expressions

`expr` allows `item + item` and `item - item`. Only `+` actually accumulates in the action (`$$ = $1 + $3`); the `-` rule has an empty action — looks unfinished.

### Defaults

From `Grammar::construct`:

- Default size override: **1 byte** (so bare `123` writes one byte).
- Default precision: `1.15.16` (sign 1 bit, whole 15 bits, fraction 16 bits → 32-bit total).

## 2. The binary output format

Written by `IffWriterBinary` (`wfsource/source/iffwrite/binary.cc`). Standard EA-IFF in shape, with a couple of World Foundry quirks.

### Chunk layout

```
+--------+--------+--------- … ---------+--- pad ---+
| ID (4) | size(4)|       payload       |  to mod 4 |
+--------+--------+--------- … ---------+-----------+
```

- `ID`: 4 raw ASCII bytes, source order (already byte-swapped in `ID::ID(unsigned long)`).
- `size`: **uint32** — payload size **excluding** the 8-byte header. Written via raw `_out->write` → **native byte order** (little-endian on x86 — *not* the big-endian of standard IFF).
- payload: nested chunks and/or raw items.
- After the payload, `align(4)` zero-pads to a 4-byte boundary.

`enterChunk` writes ID + a `0xFFFFFFFF` size placeholder; `exitChunk` seeks back and patches the real size, then aligns and bumps the parent chunk's accumulated size by `child.size + pad + 8`.

### Other primitives

| What | Bytes |
|---|---|
| `out_int8` | 1 byte |
| `out_int16` | 2 bytes, native (LE) |
| `out_int32` | 4 bytes, native (LE) |
| `out_id` | `align(4)` then 4 bytes |
| `out_string` | `strlen+1` bytes, NUL-terminated. Escape codes `\n \t \\ \" \NNN` are translated by `translate_escape_codes` first. |
| `out_string_continue` | seeks back -1 (over previous NUL), then `out_string` |
| `out_timestamp` | 4 bytes — `time_t` (Unix epoch seconds) — note: Y2038-broken |
| `out_file` | raw file bytes (`LoadBinaryFile` + `out_mem`) |
| `out_fixed` | `val × 2^fraction`, truncated to unsigned, width = 1 / 2 / 4 bytes by total bit count |

Alignment between siblings is forced to 4 (`align(4)`); the in-chunk `align()` writes zeros, while `alignFunction()` (the user-callable `.align(N)`) writes `fillChar()` instead.

### Endianness — native by design

Despite the "IFF" name, this tool does not produce an interchange file: the output is a binary blob consumed directly on the target platform (x86 or MIPS R3000). Numeric values — integers, sizes, fixed-point reals — are therefore written in the platform's **native byte order**, not the big-endian byte order of the original EA-IFF spec.

The one exception is the chunk `ID` field: `ID::ID(unsigned long)` byte-swaps so the on-disk bytes are literally the source-order ASCII characters (`'TEST'` → `54 45 53 54`), making ID matching byte-order-agnostic. All other multi-byte fields are raw native writes.

A standard IFF reader expecting big-endian data will parse IDs correctly but mis-decode every size and numeric field — expected, since that reader is not the intended consumer.

## 3. Walk-through of `test.iff.txt`

Source (from `wftools/iffcomp/test.iff.txt`):

```
{ 'TEST'
  3(1.15.16)
  0.3(1.15.16)
  0.4
  .5(1.15.16)
  "Hello string"
  "Hello string"(256)
  0y 1y 2y 3y
  4w 5w
  66666666l
  [ "TODO" ]
}
```

| Source | On-disk bytes (little-endian) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `{ 'TEST'` | `54 45 53 54  FF FF FF FF` | Chunk header `'TEST'` + size placeholder |
| `3(1.15.16)` | `00 00 03 00` | `(uint32)(3.0 × 2¹⁶)` = `0x00030000` |
| `0.3(1.15.16)` | `cc 4c 00 00` | `(uint32)(0.3 × 65536)` = 19660 = `0x00004CCC` |
| `0.4` | `66 66 00 00` | uses default precision 1.15.16 → `0x00006666` |
| `.5(1.15.16)` | `00 80 00 00` | `0.5 × 65536` = `0x00008000` |
| `"Hello string"` | `48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 73 74 72 69 6e 67 00` | 13 bytes, NUL-terminated |
| `"Hello string"(256)` | the same 13 bytes followed by 243 NULs | exactly 256 bytes total |
| `0y 1y 2y 3y` | `00 01 02 03` | four int8s |
| `4w 5w` | `04 00 05 00` | two int16s |
| `66666666l` | `2a fb f8 03` | int32 (`66666666 = 0x03F8FB2A`) |
| `[ "TODO" ]` | raw bytes of the local file `TODO` | |
| `}` | back-patches the chunk's size field | size = sum of the above |

Total payload size (header excluded): `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 13 + 256 + 4 + 4 + 4 + sizeof(TODO)` = `297 + sizeof(TODO)` bytes, written little-endian into the placeholder slot.

## 4. Walk-through of `iffwrite/test.scr`

Source (from `wfsource/source/iffwrite/test.scr`):

```
{ 'FILE'
{ 'TEST' "Some text..." }
}
```

Produces a nested chunk:

```
54 45 53 54  18 00 00 00     ; parent 'FILE', size = 24 (inner header + payload + pad)
'F''I''L''E'                 ;
                             ;
  54 45 53 54  0d 00 00 00   ; inner 'TEST', size = 13 (the C string with NUL)
  53 6f 6d 65 20 74 65 78    ; "Some text..."
  74 2e 2e 2e 00             ;
  00 00 00                   ; 3 bytes pad to 4-byte boundary
```

Note the parent chunk's size in the header *includes* the inner chunk's full 8-byte header and its 4-byte trailing pad — that's exactly what `IffWriterBinary::exitChunk` rolls into the parent (`csParent->AddToSize(child.size + pad + 8)`).

## 5. WF vs EA-IFF 85 deviations

The file produced by `iffcomp` shares the EA-IFF chunk-header shape but deviates in several ways. Because the output is a platform blob (not an interchange file), the deviations are intentional.

### Structural / breaking

| # | EA-IFF 85 | WorldFoundry |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | All multi-byte values big-endian | All numeric fields in **native byte order** (little-endian on x86, native on MIPS R3000) |
| 2 | Chunks padded to **2-byte** boundaries | Chunks padded to **4-byte** boundaries (`align(4)` hard-coded in `exitChunk`) |
| 3 | Parent `ckSize` = payload bytes only | Parent `ckSize` includes the child's 8-byte header + child's trailing pad (`AddToSize(child.size + pad + 8)`) |
| 4 | Top-level must be a FORM, LIST, or CAT | No container-type constraint; `file := chunk+` allows any top-level chunk sequence |

### Extensions

| # | EA-IFF 85 | WorldFoundry |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | No typed scalars | Fixed-point reals: `val × 2^fraction`, packed into int8/int16/int32 by total bit width |
| 6 | No string convention | C-style **NUL-terminated** strings; escape sequences (`\n \t \\ \" \NNN`) translated at write time |
| 7 | No back-patching | `.offsetof('A'::'B')` / `.sizeof('A'::'B')` inject 32-bit absolute file offsets/sizes, resolved via `Backpatch` queue |
| 8 | No string continuation | `out_string_continue` seeks back over the previous NUL and appends — concatenates adjacent string literals into one C string |
| 9 | No inline-FOURCC alignment | `out_id` calls `align(4)` before writing an inline FOURCC literal |

### Note on IDs

Chunk `ID` bytes are the one field that matches standard IFF byte order. `ID::ID(unsigned long)` byte-swaps the packed value so the on-disk bytes are the literal source-order ASCII characters — the same bytes a big-endian IFF reader would expect. This makes chunk-type matching portable even though everything else is native-endian.

## TL;DR

- **Source format**: a tiny scripting DSL whose only output is a binary IFF tree. Chunks are `{ 'ID' … }`, items are width-tagged numeric / string / file literals, with directives for alignment, timestamps, and back-patched offsets / sizes into other chunks.
- **Output format**: standard EA-IFF chunk header (`ID(4) | size(4) | payload`) with all numeric fields in **native byte order** (little-endian on x86, native on MIPS R3000) — intentional, as the output is a platform blob, not an interchange file. `align(4)` pads to 4-byte boundaries between siblings. Strings are C-style NUL-terminated. Fixed-point reals are `val << fraction_bits` truncated to int8 / int16 / int32 by their total bit width.
