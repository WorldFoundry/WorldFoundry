CHANGELOG

06 May 10
================================================================================
* remove disr3000, psxdisc, psxprof as they had already been moved to http://psxdevtools.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/psxdevtools/psxdevtools/tools/
* removed windows tools reg, wfbind, xcd (can be retrieved if windows development is needed again)
   * reg - registery reader/writer - i assume there are now "standard" tools for doing this sort of thing
   * wfbind - cool idea of appending the game cd.iff data to the end of the executable, but never worked in NT+ because of "security"
   * xcd - shrug, still want something with the ability to assign a name for a location and to be able to give "shortest matching" name for location desired

================================================================================

20 Mar 99
* added fixlex.pl; used by [all] tools which use flex and bison
* [cvs] delete recolib, moved to pigs2

================================================================================
